## 🖥️ **Overview**
Welcome to my personal portfolio website! My name is **Sidney Baraka Muriuki**, and I am a student at **PLP Academy, August cohort**. This website is designed and developed entirely using **HTML** and **CSS**. It consists of the following five webpages:
- 🏠 **Home**
- 👤 **About**
- 🛠️ **Services**
- 🗂️ **Projects**
- 📧 **Contact Form**

## 🚀 **Inspiration**
This portfolio serves as a platform to showcase my growth and progress through actions rather than words. It was created as part of a task given at the first Hackathon for **PLP students in the August cohort**. I saw this as the perfect opportunity to apply what I have learned so far and present it in a tangible form.

## 🎨 **Design and Development**
- The website was first designed on **Canva** to visualize the layout and user experience.
- After finalizing the design, I brought it to life with clean **HTML** and **CSS**.
- Icons used throughout the site were sourced from [flaticon.com](https://www.flaticon.com).

## 🌟 **Features**
- 🏠 **Home**: Introduction to who I am.
- 👤 **About**: Detailed information about my journey, skills, and vision.
- 🛠️ **Services**: A breakdown of services I offer.
- 🗂️ **Projects**: A showcase of past projects and initiatives.
- 📧 **Contact Form**: A form where visitors can reach out directly.

## 🔄 **Future Updates**
As I continue to learn and master new **frameworks** and **technologies**, this portfolio will be regularly updated to reflect my growth and new skills. Stay tuned for future updates!

## NB: Contributors
The contributors you see on the repo are one and the same person. One github account(sidnino707) was initially configured to my VS Code
but had issues with logging in. I had to create the other one (BackendSid22) which now hosts all my repos. All changes made by sid707  are the same as BackendSid22. I will be deleting sid707 soon.
